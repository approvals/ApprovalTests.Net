## Using Reporters

For an introduction on how to use reporters check out [ getting started with reporters ](./ReportersGettingStarted.md)


### Supported Diff Tools

ApprovalTests Diff Reporters use [DiffEngine](https://github.com/SimonCropp/DiffEngine) which supports the following [diff tools](https://github.com/SimonCropp/DiffEngine/#supported-diff-tools)


#### Custom Diff Tool

Custom Diff Tools can be added via DiffEngine. See: https://github.com/SimonCropp/Verify/blob/master/docs/diff-tool.custom.md


## Making Custom Reporters

Extend `IApprovalFailureReporter`. For example a file can be launched on failure:

<!-- snippet: FileLauncherReporter.cs -->
<a id='snippet-FileLauncherReporter.cs'></a>
```cs
using System.Diagnostics;
using ApprovalTests.Core;

namespace ApprovalTests.Reporters
{
    public class FileLauncherReporter : IApprovalFailureReporter
    {
        public static readonly FileLauncherReporter INSTANCE = new FileLauncherReporter();

        public void Report(string approved, string received)
        {
            QuietReporter.DisplayCommandLineApproval(approved, received);
            Process.Start(received);
        }
    }
}
```

<!-- endSnippet -->


## Joining Reporters

These classes help you combine reporters to make more powerful combinations

* FirstWorkingReporter - launch the first report for this system, only 1
* MultiReporter - launch ALL reporters


### Choosing a DiffTool preference

See [How to customize the order of DiffTools in your Reporter](howtos/CustomizingDiffToolSelectionOrder.md)

## Auto-Approving Reporters

These reporters create a commandline move file to approve the results and place it on your clipboard when a test fails.

* ClipboardReporter - This test only
* AllFailingTestsClipboardReporter - All tests (this might make a long command line)


## Continuous Integration

ApprovalTests will not launch anything if you are running on a CI machine.

Currently, we support:

<!-- snippet: continuous_integration -->
<a id='snippet-continuous_integration'></a>
```cs
TfsReporter.INSTANCE,
TfsVnextReporter.INSTANCE,
TeamCityReporter.INSTANCE,
JenkinsReporter.INSTANCE,
BambooReporter.INSTANCE,
NCrunchReporter.INSTANCE,
MightyMooseAutoTestReporter.INSTANCE,
MyGetReporter.INSTANCE,
GoContinuousDeliveryReporter.INSTANCE,
AppVeyorReporter.INSTANCE
```
<sup><a href='/src/ApprovalTests/Reporters/DefaultFrontLoaderReporter.cs#L11-L22' title='Snippet source file'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-continuous_integration' title='Start of snippet'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endSnippet -->

You can add to this by configuring the FrontLoadedReporter Annotation.
