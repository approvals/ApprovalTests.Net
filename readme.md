Capturing Human Intelligence - ApprovalTests is an open source assertion/verification library to aid unit testing.

It is compatible with most .Net unit testing frameworks (Nunit, MsTest, xUnit, MBUnit)

## What can it be used for?

Approval Tests can be used for verifying objects that require more than a simple assert. They also come prepackaged with utilities for some common .Net scenarios including:

 * Dictionaries & Collections
 * Long Strings
 * Log Files
 * [Asp.Net](https://github.com/approvals/Approvals.Net.Asp)
 * [Asp.Net Mvc](https://github.com/approvals/Approvals.Net.Asp)
 * [Winforms](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Net.WinForms)
 * [Wpf](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Net.Wpf)
 * [Entity Framework](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Net.EntityFramework)
 * [Rdlc reports](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Net.Rdlc)

## Examples

### Verifing a List

<!-- snippet: sample_test -->
<a id='snippet-sample_test'/></a>
```cs
[UseReporter(typeof(VisualStudioReporter))]
    [TestFixture]
    public class SampleTest
    {
        [Test]
        public void TestList()
        {
            var names = new[] { "Llewellyn", "James", "Dan", "Jason", "Katrina" };
            Array.Sort(names);
            Approvals.VerifyAll(names, label:"");
        }
    }
```
<sup><a href='/src/ApprovalTests.Tests/SampleTest.cs#L7-L20' title='File snippet `sample_test` was extracted from'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-sample_test' title='Navigate to start of snippet `sample_test`'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

Will Produce a File

    `SampleTest.TestList.received.txt`
	
<!-- snippet: SampleTest.TestList.approved.txt -->
<a id='snippet-SampleTest.TestList.approved.txt'/></a>
```txt
[0] = Dan
[1] = James
[2] = Jason
[3] = Katrina
[4] = Llewellyn
```
<sup><a href='/src/ApprovalTests.Tests/SampleTest.TestList.approved.txt#L1-L5' title='File snippet `SampleTest.TestList.approved.txt` was extracted from'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-SampleTest.TestList.approved.txt' title='Navigate to start of snippet `SampleTest.TestList.approved.txt`'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

It will also open these 2 files (`.received.` & `.approved.` ) in a diff editor. 

<img src="docs/images/sample_test_01_open_diff.png"  width="50%" height="50%">

You can **approve** these results by copying everything (ctrl+a, ctrl+c) and pasting it in the right hand side (ctrl+a, ctrl+v)

<img src="docs/images/sample_test_02_approving.png"  width="50%" height="50%">


In most situations, you will use one of the [supported DiffTools](docs/ApprovalTests/Reporters.md#supported-diff-tools) to examine and approve the result.

Alternatively, you can rename the `.received.` file to SampleTest.TestList.**approved**.txt and the test will now pass. 


**note:** The diff tools are **NOT** opened when the tests pass, only on failure.


## Approved File Artifacts

The `*.approved.*` files must be checked into source your source control. ApprovalTests now ignores line endings by default (so you can remove `*.approved.* binary` from your .gitattributes file if you added previously).

If you would like to verify line endings, simply add `[assembly: IgnoreLineEndingsAttribute(false)]` to your AssemblyInfo.cs

Do not add `*.received.*` files to your source control (they are transitory, and some SCMs like TFS will lock them or mark them read-only, which will break every dependent test).
