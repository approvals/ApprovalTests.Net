## What can it be used for?

Approval Tests can be used for verifying objects that require more than a simple assert. They also come prepackaged with utilities for some common .Net scenarios including:

 * Dictionaries & Collections
 * Long Strings
 * Log Files
 * [Asp.Net](https://github.com/approvals/Approvals.Net.Asp)
 * [Asp.Net Mvc](https://github.com/approvals/Approvals.Net.Asp)
 * [Winforms](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Net.WinForms)
 * [Wpf](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Net.Wpf)
 * [Entity Framework](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Net.EntityFramework)
 * [Rdlc reports](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Net.Rdlc)

## Available on NuGet

[Install-Package ApprovalTests](http://nuget.org/packages/ApprovalTests)

Nightly (CI) Builds available at myget.org:

[![ApprovalTests Nightly Build Status](https://www.myget.org/BuildSource/Badge/approvaltests?identifier=c56b6e36-ea68-4965-8cd8-e7033c66e38e "Build Status")](https://www.myget.org/gallery/approvaltests)

Note: Select "Include Prerelease" instead of "Stable Only" (`-IncludePrerelease` in powershell)


## Examples

[Sample Code](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Net/tree/master/ApprovalDemos/GettingStartedDemos)

```c#
[UseReporter(typeof(DiffReporter))]
[TestFixture]
public class SampleTest
{
	[Test]
	public void TestList()
	{
		var names = new[] {"Llewellyn", "James", "Dan", "Jason", "Katrina"};
		Array.Sort(names);
		Approvals.VerifyAll(names, "");
	}
}
```

Will Produce a File

    SampleTest.TestList.received.txt
    [0] = Dan
    [1] = James
    [2] = Jason
    [3] = Katrina
    [4] = Llewellyn

Simply rename this to SampleTest.TestList.**approved**.txt and the test will now pass.


## Approved File Artifacts

The `*.approved.*` files must be checked into source your source control. ApprovalTests now ignores line endings by default (so you can remove `*.approved.* binary` from your .gitattributes file if you added previously).

If you would like to verify line endings, simply add `[assembly: IgnoreLineEndingsAttribute(false)]` to your AssemblyInfo.cs

Do not add `*.received.*` files to your source control (they are transitory, and some SCMs like TFS will lock them or mark them read-only, which will break every dependent test).
