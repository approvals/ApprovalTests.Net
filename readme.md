ApprovalTests
====

Capturing Human Intelligence - ApprovalTests is an open source assertion/verification library to aid unit testing.

It is compatible with most .Net unit testing frameworks (Nunit, MsTest, Xunit, MBUnit)

What can it be used for?

- Dictionaries & Collections
- Long Strings

- Asp.Net Mvc
- Winforms
- Wpf
- Entity Framework
- Rdlc reports

Examples
---
[Sample Code](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Net/tree/master/ApprovalDemos/GettingStartedDemos)

   	[UseReporter(typeof(DiffReporter))]
	[TestFixture]
	public class SampleTest
	{
		[Test]
		public void TestList()
		{
			var names = new[] {"Llewellyn", "James", "Dan", "Jason", "Katrina"};
			Array.Sort(names);
			Approvals.VerifyAll(names, "");
		}
	}

Will Produce a File 

    SampleTest.TestList.received.txt
    [0] = Dan
    [1] = James
    [2] = Jason
    [3] = Katrina
    [4] = Llewellyn

Simply rename this to SampleTest.TestList.**approved**.txt and the test will now pass.

Approved File Artifacts
---

The `*.approved.*` files must be checked into source your source control. This can be an issue with git as it will change the line endings. 
The suggested fix is to add
`*.approved.* binary` to your `.gitattributes`

Do not add `*.received.*` files to your source control (they are transitory, and some SCMs like TFS will lock them or mark them read-only, which will break every dependent test).
