Welcome to ApprovalTests.
====

Please add:

```
[UseReporter(typeof(DiffReporter))]
```

to your class, test method or assembly.

Why:
----

ApprovalTests uses the `[UseReporter]` attribute from your test class, method or assembly. When you do this ApprovalTest will launch the result using that reporter, for example in your diff tool.

You can find several reporters in `ApprovalTests.Reporters` namespace, or create your own by extending the `ApprovalTests.Core.IApprovalFailureReporter` interface.

Best Practice:
----

Add an *assembly* level configuration. Create a file in your base directory with the name `ApprovalTestsConfig.cs`, and the contents:

```
using ApprovalTests.Reporters;

[assembly: UseReporter(typeof(DiffReporter))]
```
