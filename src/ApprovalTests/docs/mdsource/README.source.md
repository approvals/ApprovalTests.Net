## Features

As new features are added, they will be [documented here](Features.md)


## Main concepts for ApprovalTests

[Reporters](Reporters.md#top) Namers & Writers are the 3 pieces that allow ApprovalTests to work.

 * **Writers** write to a file.
 * **Namers** figure out what the file should be called and where it is located.
 * **Reporters** are called on failure to help you determine what went wrong.
