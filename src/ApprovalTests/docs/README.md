## Main concepts for ApprovalTests

[Reporters](Reporters.md#top) Namers & Writers are the 3 pieces that allow ApprovalTests to work.

 * **Writers** write to a file.
 * **Namers** figure out what the file should be called and where it is located.
 * **Reporters** are called on failure to help you determine what went wrong.


## Approval Output Files

* [Environment SpecificTests](EnvironmentSpecificTests.md)
