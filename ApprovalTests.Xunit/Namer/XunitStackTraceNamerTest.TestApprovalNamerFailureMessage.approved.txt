Could Not Detect Test Framework

Either:
1) Optimizer Inlined Test Methods
2) An async test with the same method name as another async method

Solutions:
1)

a) Add [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
b) Set Build->Opitmize Code to False 
   & Build->Advanced->DebugInfo to Full

or

2) Rename the methods that are named the same as the async test.

or

3) Approvals is not set up to use your test framework.

It currently supports [NUnit, MsTest, MbUnit, xUnit.net, xUnit.extensions, Machine.Specifications (MSpec)]

Solution:
To add one use ApprovalTests.Namers.StackTraceParsers.StackTraceParser.AddParser() method to add implementation of ApprovalTests.Namers.StackTraceParsers.IStackTraceParser with support for your testing framework.
To learn how to implement one see http://blog.approvaltests.com/2012/01/creating-namers.html
